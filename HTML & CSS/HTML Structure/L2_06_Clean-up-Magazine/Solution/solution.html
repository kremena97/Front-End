    <h2>Discover the shortlist in the July issue of Food and Travel</h2>


    <p><strong>The shortlist is in. Cast your vote now.</strong></p>
    <p>Eight
        years ago we set out to create a series of awards that were unique. We
        wanted to impartially identify the very best in the game, judged by
        experts who could draw on real-life experiences to inform their vote.
        They had to be people with unrivalled knowledge and passion for travel
        and food. They had to be people like you. Unlike other industry awards,
        ours are entirely nominated and voted on by Food and Travel readers.</p>
    <p>Your first nominations are in and we are pleased to reveal the shortlist. <a
